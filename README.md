# Legends-of-Runeterra-deckroll was created to create random decks with a lot of configuration options and the ability to create decks for a whole tournament.
If you have questions or ideas on how to improve this tool feel free to ask/suggest them.
I hope the main.py is self-explanatory.
Anyway I will add all examples on how to use it in the future.
Happy deckrolling everyone!

If you want to use it, you need to clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/Ghostdriver/Legends-of-Runeterra-deckroll.git
Necessary for using it is Python 3.10 and I used poetry as packet manager. It can be installed following https://python-poetry.org/docs/
Afterwards you have to install the packages with poetry install and should be able to just start the Pythonscript. Adjust to your needs.
