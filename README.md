# Legends-of-Runeterra-deckroll was created to create random decks with a lot of configuration options and the ability to create decks for a whole tournament.
If you have questions or ideas on how to improve this tool feel free to ask/suggest them.
I hope the main.py is self-explanatory.
Anyway I will add all examples on how to use it in the future.
Happy deckrolling everyone!
